The Artificial Intelligence Dietician is a bot with artificial intelligence about human diets. 
It acts as a diet consultant similar to a real dietician. The system too asks the data mentioned 
from the user like how many hours the user works, his height, weight, age, etc. and 
processes it. It then calculates the nutrient value needed to satisfy user needs. Based on the 
classification analysis defined, the system shows an appropriate diet to the users and asks 
for affirmation regarding the same. The methods of machine learning that accompanied the 
creation of the AI Dietician chatbot. For the purpose of this investigation, the prediction 
system was constructed with the help of different classification algorithms: Naive Bayes, 
neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines. After assessing the 
performance of a variety of models, the one that performed the best was selected for use of 
the development of AI Dietician chatbot.
