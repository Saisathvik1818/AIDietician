## 👨‍💻 About the Project

The **AI Dietician Bot** collects user input, including details such as:
- Hours of work
- Height
- Weight
- Age

It processes this information to calculate the nutrient requirements needed to satisfy the user’s dietary needs. Based on classification analysis, the system recommends an appropriate diet plan and seeks user confirmation.

The chatbot is built using machine learning models, with a focus on accuracy and efficiency. Several classification algorithms were evaluated to optimize predictions:

- **Naive Bayes**
- **Neural Networks**
- **Random Forests**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

After performance assessment, the best-performing model was selected for implementation.

## 🔟 Purpose

The project aims to:

- **Simplify Diet Planning**: Offer personalized diet recommendations based on user data.
- **Improve Health Awareness**: Encourage healthier lifestyles through tailored nutrition guidance.
- **Automate Expert Advice**: Mimic human dieticians with AI-driven predictions.
